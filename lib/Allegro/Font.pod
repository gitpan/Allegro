=head1 NAME

Allegro::Font - Allegro font object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allegro does not provide any routines to directly create, load or save 
fonts.  Therefore an Allegro::Font object will only be created by 
accessing the objects in a Datafile, and can be passed to the text drawing 
methods of a Bitmap or Display object.

All methods of Allegro::Font should be considered private.
